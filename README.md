# terminal_website

## description:
This is a website which looks like a terminal. That means it is a single page website. 
For now this page has only a few commands like: open; founder; time; date. But in the future I want to use to condense data information and data analysis.

## goal:
My goal with this project is build a plataform that i could display data from web scrapping. For now it's a simple structure.
